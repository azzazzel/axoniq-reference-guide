= Command Line Interface

The Axon Server provides a _command line utility_ which allows for updating the Axon Server configuration through scripts or from the command line interface.â€Œ The utility is available as a jar file (axonserver-cli.jar) which is available as part of the Axon Server distributable (SE/EE).

== Quick Summary

A quick summary of the various commands is depicted below.
Each command has a specific link:command-line-interface.md#format[format] to it and link:command-line-interface.md#access-control[access control] can also be enabled on it for security purposes.+++<table>++++++<thead>++++++<tr>++++++<th style="text-align:left">+++Area (Server Edition)+++</th>+++

=== â€ŒFormat

The general format of any command line command is:

[,text]
----
java -jar axonserver-cli.jar <Command> <command options> -S <server-to-send-command-to> -t <auth_token>
----

Or when running from a bash-like shell:

[,text]
----
axonserver-cli.jar <Command>  <command options> -S <server-to-send-command-to> -t <auth_token>
----

The option -S with the url to the Axon Server is optional, if it is omitted it defaults to http://localhost:8024/.â€Œ While for Axon Server SE, the URL for the Axon Server SE will be the single running node, for Axon Server EE, the URL should be pointing to any node serving the __admin_ context within an Axon Server EE cluster.

The `<command options>` valid for all commands, are: `-S`, `-s`, `-i`, `-o`.
Their effect is described in the table below.

|===
| Option - Short | Option - Long | Description

| `-S`
| `server`
| Server to send command to (default http://localhost:8024)

| `-s`
| `https`
| Use HTTPS (SSL,TLS) to connect to the server, rather than HTTP.

| `-i`
| `insecure-ssl`
| Do not check the certificate when connecting using HTTPS.

| `-o`
| `output`
| Output format (txt,json)
|===

For options specific to individual commands, see the descriptions of the commands below.

=== Access control

When running Axon Server with access control enabled, executing commands remotely requires an access token.
This needs to be provided with the -t option.
When you run a command on the Axon Server node itself from the directory where Axon Server was started, you don't have to provide a token.â€Œ

For Axon Server Standard Edition the token is specified in the axonserver.properties file (property name = _axoniq.axonserver.token_).
In Enterprise Edition you need to register an application with ADMIN role, and you can use that application's token to perform command line commands remotely.â€Œ The token needs to be supplied using the _*-t*_ option in any of the commands.

== Commands

This section describes all commands supported by the command line interface, grouped by the specific area.â€Œ For all command line commands there are 2 common (optional) parameters:

* _*-S*_ refers to the server to send the command to and if not supplied connects by default to http://localhost:8024.
For Axon Server SE, the URL for the Axon Server SE will be the single running node, while for Axon Server EE the URL should be pointing to any node serving the __admin_ context within an Axon Server EE cluster.
* _*-t*_  refers to the access token to authenticate at the server to which the command is sent to.

=== Users +++<a id="user">++++++</a>+++

When using Axon Server with access control enabled, users need to be defined to access the Axon Server Console's Dashboard.
Users with only READ role can view the information in the console dashboard but not make any changes, users with ADMIN role can make changes.â€Œ

==== _*users*_*â€Œ*

Returns a list of all registered users and their roles.â€Œ

[,text]
----
$ java -jar axonserver-cli.jar users [-o json]
----

_Optional parameters_

* _*-o*_ produces output in JSON format instead of formatted text
* _*-S*_ refers to the server to send the command to and if not supplied connects by default to http://localhost:8024.
For Axon Server SE, the URL for the Axon Server SE will be the single running node, while for Axon Server EE the URL should be pointing to any node serving the __admin_ context within an Axon Server EE cluster.
* _*-t*_  refers to the access token to authenticate at the server to which the command is sent to.

_*register-user*_*â€Œ*

Registers a user with specified roles.
For Axon Server SE, the only two roles possible are READ/ADMIN while for Axon Server EE, the following roles can be granted:

* ADMIN
* CONTEXT_ADMIN
* DISPATCH_COMMANDS

* MONITOR
* PUBLISH_EVENTS
* READ_EVENTS
* SUBSCRIBE_COMMAND_HANDLER
* SUBSCRIBE_QUERY_HANDLER
* USE_CONTEXT/VIEW_CONFIGURATION

In addition to the role name you can also supply the context to which this role applies like _\{role_name}@\{context_name}_.
For Axon Server SE, the only context available is the _default_ context so the role will only apply to that context (hence not necessary to supply the context name).
For Axon Server EE, the specific context can be included as required.
Also if no context is mentioned in Axon Server EE, the role is granted to the user for all registered contexts.

[,text]

This command returns the generated token to use.
Note that this token is only generated once, if you lose it you must delete the application and register it again to get a new token.
If you want to define the token yourself, you can provide one in the command line command using the `-T` flag, e.g.:
