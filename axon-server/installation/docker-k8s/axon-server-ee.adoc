== Docker Image

AxonIQ provides a ready to use https://hub.docker.com/r/axoniq/axonserver-enterprise[Axon Server EE image] *for development and trial purposes*.
There are two images available: one with Axon Server running as the user "[.code]``root``" and one with Axon Server running as user "[.code]``axonserver``".
Both images are based on "debug" images from https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless[Google's Distroless series], which means they include a (limited) shell that allows you to connect "into" the running image and perform some commands.
Naturally you should not use these for production because of this, but they are perfect for development and test environments.

* The "[.code]``root``" image of version 4.5.3 is available as "[.code]``axoniq/axonserver-enterprise:4.5.3-dev``" and is based on "[.code]``gcr.io/distroless/java:11-debug``".
This image is particularly useful for running in Docker Desktop, as it will not have any trouble creating files and directories as user "[.code]``root``".
* The "[.code]``axonserver``" image of version 4.5.3 is available as "[.code]``axoniq/axonserver-enterprise:4.5.3-dev-nonroot``" and is based on "[.code]``gcr.io/distroless/java:11-debug-nonroot``".
This image is more secure and useful in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.
You should take care to declare the user- and group-id, both of which are `1001` and are named "[.code]``axonserver``".
Doing this will ensure that any mounted volumes will be writable by the user running Axon Server.

Version 4.5.3 is the first version for which we have released these images, and later versions will follow.
Please replace "4.5.3" on this page with the appropriate version number as needed.
The images export the following volumes:

* "[.code]``/axonserver/config``"
+
This is where you can add configuration files, such as an additional `axonserver.properties` and the license file.
However, you can also opt to use, e.g., Kubernetes or Docker-compose secrets.
Note that Axon Server EE assumes it can write to the directory configured with "[.code]``axoniq.axonserver.enterprise.licenseDirectory``", so you don't have to put the license on all nodes.

* "[.code]``/axonserver/data``"
+
This is where the ControlDB, the PID file, and a copy of the application logs are written to.

* "[.code]``/axonserver/events``"
+
In this volume the Event Store is created, with a single directory per context.

* "[.code]``/axonserver/log``"
+
In this volume the Replication Logs are created, with a single directory per Replication Group.

* "[.code]``/axonserver/exts``"
+
In this volume you can place Extension JAR-files, such as the LDAP and OAuth2 extensions.

* "[.code]``/axonserver/plugins``"
+
In this volume Axon Server will place all uploaded plugins.

== Building you own Image

A starter Dockerfile is included below which can be tailored as per your requirements.

The starter file helps create the image in multiple stages,

* The image will be based on a compact image from Google's "`distroless`" base images at the gcr.io repository, in this case "`gcr.io/distroless/java:11`".
* The first stage creates the directories that will become our volumes.
This step cannot be performed in the Distroless image, because that image does not provide a shell.
* The second stage begins by copying the home directory with its volume mount points, carefully keeping ownership set to the new user.
* The last steps copy the executable jar named axonserver.jar and a common set of properties.
It marks the volume mounting points and exposed ports and finally specifies the command to start Axon Server EE.

FROM busybox as source

RUN mkdir -p /axonserver/config /axonserver/data /axonserver/events /axonserver/log /axonserver/exts

FROM gcr.io/distroless/java:11

COPY --from=source /axonserver /axonserver
COPY axonserver.jar axonserver.properties /axonserver/

WORKDIR /axonserver

VOLUME [ "/axonserver/config", "/axonserver/data", "/axonserver/events", "/axonserver/log", "/axonserver/exts", "/axonserver/plugins"  ]
EXPOSE 8024/tcp 8124/tcp 8224/tcp

ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "-jar", "./axonserver.jar" ]
----

If you want to build a  "nonroot" version, you need to adjust this as follows:

[,text]
----
FROM busybox as source
RUN addgroup -S -g 1001 axonserver \
    && adduser -S -u 1001 -G axonserver -h /axonserver -D axonserver \
    && mkdir -p /axonserver/config /axonserver/data /axonserver/events /axonserver/log /axonserver/exts \
    && chown -R axonserver:axonserver /axonserver

FROM gcr.io/distroless/java:11

COPY --from=source /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/
COPY --from=source --chown=axonserver /axonserver /axonserver

COPY --chown=axonserver axonserver.jar axonserver.properties /axonserver/

USER axonserver
WORKDIR /axonserver

VOLUME [ "/axonserver/config", "/axonserver/data", "/axonserver/events", "/axonserver/log", "/axonserver/exts", "/axonserver/plugins" ]
EXPOSE 8024/tcp 8124/tcp 8224/tcp

ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "-jar", "./axonserver.jar" ]
----

As you can see this will start by creating the user "[.code]``axonserver``" belonging to a group with the same name.
When copying the directory, we now have to ensure that ownership transfers correctly and specify the user to run as, but otherwise it looks pretty similar.

For the common properties (axonserver.properties), the minimum set can be added to ensure that the volumes get mounted and logs generated.
Again these can be tailored as per the deployment requirements.

----

Place the Dockerfile, the Axon Server EE jar file (axonserver.jar), the Axon Server EE client jar file (axonserver-cli.jar) and the axonserver.properties in the current directory.
Assuming we are building version 4.5.3, the image can be constructed using the following command:

[,bash]
----
$ docker build --tag my-repository/axonserver-enterprise:4.5.3 .
----

This completes the construction of the Docker image.
The image can pushed to your local repository or you could keep it local if you only want to run it on your development machine.
The next step is to run it either using link:axon-server-ee.md#docker-compose[Docker Compose] or link:axon-server-ee.md#kubernetes[Kubernetes].

== Docker Compose

Axon Server EE is meant to be run in a distributed manner i.e.
as a cluster where there will be multiple instances of Axon Server EE nodes running all interconnected to each other.

The installation process assumes that Docker Compose will be used to run a 3-node Axon Server EE cluster i.e.
running 3 services of the same container image we built above.
Let us designate these services as "_axonserver-1_", "_axonserver-2_" and "_axonserver-3_".
We will also give a tag to the image that we constructed above as "_my-repository/axonserver-enterprise:4.5.3_".

Each container instance will use separate volumes for "`data`", "`events`", and "`log`".
We will use "secrets" to inject the license file, tokens as well as the cluster/context definitions using the link:../local-installation/axon-server-ee.md#auto-clustering[autocluster] mechanism.
An environment variable is added to tell Axon Server about the location of the license file.

The complete docker-compose file is depicted below.

The "`axonserver-token`" secret is used to allow the CLI to talk with nodes.

A similar approach can be used to configure more secrets for the certificates, and so enable SSL.

== Kubernetes

*For example purposes only*

The examples below show only one of the ways you could deploy Axon Server to Kubernetes.
As discussed in https://developer.axoniq.io/w/revisiting-axon-server-in-containers[this Blog article], there are many aspects that you need to carefully plan ahaead for.
A more complete set of examples can be found in the "https://github.com/AxonIQ/running-axon-server[Running Axon Server]" GitHub repository.
We especially recommend using https://github.com/AxonIQ/running-axon-server/tree/master/3-k8s/4-k8s-ee-ssts-tls[the "Singleton StatefulSet" approach].
Although the complexity of deploying any application to Kubernetes can be overwhelming, we strongly recommend you to study this subject carefully.
The examples we provide are not necessarily the best approach for your particular situation, so be careful about copying them without any further modifications, if only because they generate self-signed certificates that have a one-year validity.

###Creating the Secrets and ConfigMap

The deployment of Axon Server EE on Kubernetes essentially follows the same principle as we have seen for Axon Server SE i.e.
using Stateful Sets.
However, to cater to the distributed deployment topology of Axon Server EE, there may be some changes that would need to be done.

An important thing to consider is the use of a "nonroot" image.
This is due to the fact that volumes are mounted as owned by the mount location's owner in Docker, while Kubernetes uses a special security context, defaulting to "[.code]``root``".
Since a "nonroot" image runs Axon Server under its own user, it has no rights on the mounted volume other than "`read`".
The context can be specified, but only through the user or group's ID, and not using their name as we did in the image, because that name does not exist in the k8s management context.
So we have to adjust the first stage to specify a specific numeric value _(here we have given 1001)_ , and then use that value in the security context of the Stateful set which we shall see below.

We would need to supply a licence/token file (for client applications) and cluster/context definitions via an axonserver.properties file.
Unlike Docker Compose, Kubernetes mounts Secrets and ConfigMaps as directories rather than files, so we need to split license and configuration to two separate locations.
For the license secret we can use a new location "`/axonserver/license/axoniq.license`" and adjust the environment variable to match.
For the system token we'll use "`/axonserver/security/token.txt`", and for the properties file we'll use a ConfigMap that we mount on top of the "`/axonserver/config`" directory.

These can be created using "kubectl" directly from their respective file as depicted below.
It is recommended to create a dedicated namespace before creating the secrets and the config maps.

[,text]
----
$ kubectl create secret generic axonserver-license --from-file=./axoniq.license -n ${axonserver-ns}
secret/axonserver-license created
$ kubectl create secret generic axonserver-token --from-file=./axoniq.token -n ${axonserver-ns}
secret/axonserver-token created
$ kubectl create configmap axonserver-properties --from-file=./axonserver.properties -n ${axonserver-ns}
configmap/axonserver-properties created
$
----

In the descriptor we now have to declare the secret, add a volume for it, and mount the secret on the volume.
Then a list of volumes has to be added to link the actual license and properties.

=== Deploying Axon Server

The complete spec for the Axon Server EE Stateful set is given below.
This includes the security context, the volume mounts, the readiness and liveness probes and finally the volumes.

The StatefulSet can be applied using the following command (assuming that the StatefulSet spec is stored in the file "axonserver-sts.yml").

[,text]
----
$ kubectl apply -f axonserver-sts.yml -n ${axonserver-ns}

The next step would be to create the two services required for Axon Server EE i.e.
axonserver-gui on 8024 (HTTP) and axonserver on 8124 (gRPC).

      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: axonserver-gui
          servicePort: 8024
---
----

The services use an Ingress to allow incoming traffic and can be deployed with the following command (assuming that the Service(s) spec is stored in the file "axonserver-ing.yml").

[,text]
----
$ kubectl apply -f axonserver-ing.yml -n ${axonserver-ns}
service/axonserver-gui created
service/axonserver created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/axonserver created
----

The final step is to scale out the cluster.
The simplest approach, and most often correct one, is to use a scaling factor other than 1, letting Kubernetes take care of deploying several instances.
This means we will get several nodes that Kubernetes can dynamically manage and migrate as needed, while at the same time fixing the name and storage.
We will get a number suffixed to the name starting at 0, so a scaling factor of 3 gives us "`axonserver-0`" through "`axonserver-2`".

[,text]
----
$ kubectl scale sts axonserver -n ${axonserver-ns} --replicas=3
statefulset.apps/axonserver scaled
----

This completes a basic setup to help install Axon Server EE on Kubernetes.
The customer can choose to tailor the entire setup based on their requirements and usage of Kubernetes.
