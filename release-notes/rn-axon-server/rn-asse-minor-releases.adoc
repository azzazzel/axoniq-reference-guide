= Minor Releases Standard Edition

This page provides a dedicated overview of patch releases for the Axon Server (Standard Edition) releases

== Release 4.6

=== Release 4.6.7

* Fix: invalid sequence number error when submitting events when the latest segment only contains non-domain events

=== Release 4.6.6

* Fix: memory leak due to a closed event processor keeping memory
* In the UI, the pagination settings for the tables are now kept in the current session
* Updated gRPC and Netty versions to avoid startup error on alpine linux
* Axon Server now checks for a configured token when it is started with access control enabled
* New logging statement to indicate that development mode is enabled

=== Release 4.6.5

* Fix: update flow control library
* Fix: change health status for commands to only show warning when there are queued messages and no permits
* Updated audit logging for authentication failures

=== Release 4.6.4

* Fix: change column name in event processor overview to "Active Segments"
* Fix: null pointer exception popup in dashboard

=== Release 4.6.3

* Fix: reading aggregate events searches for older events when the last event sequence number is the same as the snapshot sequence number
* New property for index, axoniq.axonserver.event.segments-for-sequence-number-check, defines the number of segments that Axon Server will check for events on an aggregate when an event with sequence number 0 is stored.
The default value for this property is 10.
For performance reasons, if you increase this property to a value higher than 100 it is recommended to also increase the axoniq.axonserver.event.max-bloom-filters-in-memory property.

=== Release 4.6.2

* Fix: reading aggregate events hangs on JVM Error
* Fix: canceling an event store query through the gRPC interface does not close the stream

=== Release 4.6.1

* Security update: updated control database settings

== Release 4.5

=== Release 4.5.16

* Fix: reading aggregate events searches for older events when the last event sequence number is the same as the snapshot sequence number
* New property for index, axoniq.axonserver.event.segments-for-sequence-number-check, defines the number of segments that Axon Server will check for events on an aggregate when an event with sequence number 0 is stored.
The default value for this property is 10.
For performance reasons, if you increase this property to a value higher than 100 it is recommended to also increase the axoniq.axonserver.event.max-bloom-filters-in-memory property.

* Fix: Handle queries with same request type but different response type
* New metrics added:
 ** file.bloom.open: counts the number of bloom filter segments opened since start
 ** file.bloom.close: counts the number of bloom filter segments closed since start
 ** file.segment.open: counts the number of event store segments opened since start

Notes:

* Default value for configuration property axoniq.axonserver.event.events-per-segment-prefetch is decreased from 50 to 10.

=== Release 4.5.2

* Improved performance for reading aggregates
+
Axon Server is now reading events for an aggregate from multiple event store segments in parallel.
