= Major Releases

== Release 4.6.0

Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition

New features:

* Streaming queries (requires Axon Framework version 4.6.0).
When returning a collection of results from a query, the results can be streamed instead of collecting them in the query handler first.

Enhancements:

* Number of events per transaction is no longer limited to 32K.
* Support for using the CLI when the caller is behind a proxy.
* livenessstate and readinessstate probes are now included in the /actuator/health endpoint output by default
* Properties now support more readable values using units
* Changing event processor states through Axon Server now waits for a result from the client
* Plugins can now use AxonServerInformationProvider to get information on the Axon Server version
* UI updated
* show complex metadata values in query results

Dependency updates:

* updated gRPC and Netty versions
* updated Spring Boot version
* moved to OpenAPI for Swagger support

Bug fixes:

* moved reading indexes from the gRPC thread to prevent blocking these threads

Notes:

* For the Swagger endpoint use  /swagger-ui.html or /swagger-ui/index.html.
* The generic endpoint for actuator is /actuator (/actuator/ no longer works)

Enterprise Edition only

New features:

* Clients can now perform administrative operations in Axon Server through the axonserver-connector-java (requires version 4.6.0 of the connector).
* Support for updating properties for an existing context

Enhancements:

* Large message support.
Before increasing the max-message-size on Axon Server had the effect that the replication log segments were also increased in size.
This dependency is no longer there.
* Clients can now also connect to nodes in a replication group that are not primary or messaging-only nodes.
To force clients to connect to primary or message-only nodes, set the property force-connection-to-primary-or-messaging-node to true

Bug fixes:

* not able to use an empty internal domain value if the domain was specified for the client connections (requires property axoniq.axonserver.experimental.allow-empty-domain set to true and axoniq.axonserver.internal-domain defined with an empty string)
* fix a timing issue in LeadershipStatusNotifier that can cause the leader to forget about its own leader status

Notes:

* For the swagger endpoint use  /swagger-ui.html or /swagger-ui/index.html.
* The generic endpoint for actuator is /actuator (/actuator/ no longer works)
* If you are using the LDAP or OATH extension you need to use the 4.6.0 version of these extensions as because of the Spring Boot version update

== Release 4.5

Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition

New features:

* Support for customer-defined plugins to add custom actions to adding/reading events and snapshots and executing commands and (subscription queries) For more information see xref:../../axon-server/administration/plugins.adoc[plugins].
* Search snapshots in Axon Dashboard

Enhancements:

* Flow control for reading aggregates
* Updates in user permissions now have immediate effect (even if the user is logged in)
* Logging of illegal access to Axon Server gRPC services
* Improved monitoring of available disk space (see xref:../../axon-server/administration/monitoring/actuator-endpoints.adoc[actuator-endpoints])
* List of used 3rd party libraries available from Dashboard
* Axon Dashboard checks for Axon Server version updates

Dependency updates:

* updated gRPC and Netty versions
* updated Spring Boot version
* updated Swagger version

Notes:

* Due to the update of the Spring Boot version there are some minor changes to the output of the /actuator/health endpoint.
This endpoint now uses the element "components" instead of "details" to output the health per subcategory.
* The swagger endpoint has changed from /swagger-ui.html to /swagger-ui/.

Standard Edition only

Bug fixes:

* Read aggregate snapshots from closed segments fixed

Enterprise Edition only

New features:

* Authentication via Google OAuth (via extension)
* Authentication and authorization with LDAP
* New role VIEW_CONFIGURATION allowing user read only access to the configuration of Axon Server in the Dashboard

Enhancements:

* Option to use a separate SSL key file for communication between Axon Server nodes (see property internal-private-key-file in xref:../../axon-server/administration/admin-configuration/configuration.adoc[configuration])
* License status added to health page (see xref:../../axon-server/administration/monitoring/actuator-endpoints.adoc[actuator-endpoints])
* Migration tool now supports migrating from a MongoDB event store to Axon Server

Bug fixes:

* memory leak in the replication group leader could cause elections
* incorrect version number shown in login page and error page in Dashboard
* invalid number of active subscription queries displayed in Dashboard
* exception initializing a context for the replication group leader on restart after unclean shutdown

== Release 4.4

Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition

* Axon Server can now act as an event scheduler
* Tag-based routing of commands and queries
* Support fom token store identifiers to identify which tracking event processors share a token store

Enterprise Edition only

* Tracking event processors can now read from any primary node
* Reading aggregates will read events from followers and only request the leader for latest events
* Introduction of replication groups containing one or more contexts to reduce overhead in replication process
* New index type to improve speed in reading aggregates
* Axon Server Enterprise can now start without a license and has the option to upload licenses to the cluster
* Cluster templates to initialize a cluster including replication groups, contexts, users and applications based on a   template
* Multi-tier storage to keep only recent data at primary nodes
* Some storage properties can now be set at the context level

== Release 4.3

* Improved support for running in containers
* New option to configure cluster information in configuration files, to automatically build cluster at startup
* Support load factor for commands
* Support for moving Axon Server cluster to other nodes
* Option to remove a node from a context without deleting the event store on that node
* Separate audit log for configuration changes
* Changed metrics to use common names and tags

== Release 4.2

* Delete leader from group is now possible.
* Removing a context from a node, deletes all data (including event data) on that node.

+
You will see new files created on AxonServer nodes in the log directory (axoniq.axonserver.replication.log-storage-folder).
+
Do not delete those files manually!

* Default setting for health endpoint (/actuator/heath) has changed to show more details.
* Change in TLS configuration for communication between AxonServer nodes (new property axoniq.axonserver.ssl.internal-trust-manager-file)
