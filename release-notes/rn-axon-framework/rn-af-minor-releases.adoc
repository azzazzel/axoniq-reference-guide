=== Release 4.5.10

* Axon's test fixtures perform a "deep equals" operation, using reflection as they go.
JDK17,  rightfully so, does not allow that for all classes.
To solve scenarios where users utilize objects from, for example, `java.lang`,  we have introduced a distinct `DeepEqualsMatcher` in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2210[#2210].
This matcher implementation considers the situation that an `InaccessibleObjectException` might be thrown from Axon's test fixtures,  correctly dealing with the scenario by assuming the assertion failed.
* Contributor https://github.com/fabio-couto[`fabio-couto`] noticed a predicament within the `PooledStreamingEventProcessor` (PSEP for short) when they were facing connectivity issues with their RDBMS.
In the face of these issues, the PSEP coordinator is incapable of fetching events, resulting in canceled work packages.
As part of canceling, the PSEP actively tries to release token claims, which is yet another database operation.
This loop of several connectivity issues causes the PSEP to enter a state it could not recover from.
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2225[#2225], provided by `fabio-couto`, solves this predicament.
* A fix was introduced to the `EventTypeUpcaster` to solve issues further down the upcasting chain.
Contributor https://github.com/dakr0013[`dakr0013`] noted that upcaster invoked _after_ an `EventTypeUpcaster` failed because the expected intermediate event type was adjusted to `Object`.
`dakr0013` provided a pull request, which we made some adjustments in PR https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2177[#2177] to accommodate additional scenarios.

You can check out the https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.5.10[release notes] when you're looking for an exhaustive list of all the changes.

=== Release 4.5.9

This release brings three adjustments worth mentioning to the framework, namely:

. Contributor `oysteing` opened issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/2154[#2154],  describing that the `ReplayStatus` enumeration never entered the `REPLAY` status for a `PooledStreamingEventProcessor`.
We resolved this finding in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2168[#2168] by ensuring the `TrackingToken` carries the replay status as intended.
. The `AggregateTestFixture` incorrectly assumed a test succeeded in the absence of an exception when you would use the `expectExceptionMessage` validation step.
We resolved this predicament in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2127[#2127].
. Lastly, we further upgraded the XStream dependency for a CVE in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2097[this] pull request.
This time, for https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-43859.html[CVE-2021-43859].

For an exhaustive list of the changes in 4.5.9, we refer to the https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.5.9[release notes].

=== Release 4.5.8

This release brings two adjustments worth mentioning to the framework.
Namely:

. We spotted a bug within the `PooledStreamingEventProcessor` (PSEP).
More specifically, whenever a subset of the tokens for the PSEP existed, calculating the lower bound of a token would cause failures.
We addressed this predicament in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2082[#2082].
. We introduce an enhancement in the API of the `CommandGateway`.
You can now directly insert `MetaData` whenever using the `CommandGateway#send` or `CommandGateway#sendAndWait` operations.
You can verify the changes https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2085[#here].

=== Release 4.5.7

This https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.5.7[release] contains a single fix.
Namely, pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2067[#2067].
This pull request solves a bug that had the `PooledStreamingEventProcessor` not handle new events resulting from an `EventMultiUpcaster`.
The kudos for spotting the bug go to https://discuss.axoniq.io/u/daysleeper75[Magnus Heino], which started a discussion on our https://discuss.axoniq.io/t/events-other-than-first-event-created-by-contextawareeventmultiupcaster-are-not-processed-by-eventhandler/3756[forum] after he noticed the issue.

=== Release 4.5.6

* Although Axon Framework doesn't use the log4j-core dependency directly, we updated it to the most recent version for ease of mind.
You can follow these increments in issues https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2038[#2038], https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2040[#2040] and https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2052[#2052].
* Contributor `jasperfect` spotted a predicament with duplicate aggregate creation combined with using caches.
Axon didn't invalidate the cache as it should have, causing unexpected behavior.
You can find the issue description https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/2017[here].
Additionally, you can find the pull request solving the problem https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2027[here].
* Contributor `shubhojitr` stated in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/2051[#2051] that the `axonserver-connector-java` project pulled in a non-secure version of `grpc-netty`.
As this isn't an issue on Axon Framework itself, we solved the problem under the connector project.
As a follow-up, we incremented the framework's version for the `axonserver-connector-java` project to 4.5.4, which contains the most recent version of the `grpc-bom`.

For an exhaustive list of all the changes, check out the https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.5.6[4.5.6 release notes].

=== Release 4.5.5

* The auto-configuration we introduced for `XStream` used a suboptimal approach.
We assumed searching for the `@ComponentScan` would suffice but didn't consider that Spring enabled SpEL operations in the annotation's properties.
This approach thus caused some applications to break on start-up.
As such, this approach is replaced entirely by using the outcome of the `AutoConfigurationPackages#get(BeanFactory)` method.
For those interested in the details of the solution, check out https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1976[this] pull request.
Kudos to contributor `maverick1601` for drafting issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1963[#1963] explaining the predicament.
* We introduced an optimization towards updating the `TrackingToken`.
In (distributed) environments where the configuration states several segments per Streaming Processor, there are always threads receiving events that they're not in charge of due to the configured `SequencingPolicy`.
The old implementation eagerly updated the token in such scenarios, but this didn't benefit the end-user immediately.
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1999[#1999] introduce a wait period for 'event-less-batches', for both the `TrackingEventProcessor` and `PooledStreamingEventProcessor`.
This adjustment minimizes the number of token updates performed by both processor implementations.
* The introduction of Spring Boot version 2.6.0 brought an issue to light within Axon's Spring usage.
The `AbstractAnnotationHandlerBeanPostProcessor` took `FactoryBean` instances into account when searching for message handling methods.
This approach, however, is not recommended by Spring, which they enforced in their latest release.
The result was circular dependency exceptions on start-up whenever somebody used Spring Boot 2.6.0.
The fix was simple, though, as we should simply ignore `FactoryBean` instances.
After spotting the issue, we resolved it in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/2013[this] pull request.

For an exhaustive list of all the changes, check out the https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.5.5[4.5.5 release notes].

=== Release 4.5.4

* First and foremost, we updated the XStream version to 1.4.18.
This upgrade was a requirement since several https://x-stream.github.io/changes.html[CVE's] were noted for XStream version 1.4.17.
As a consequence of XStream's solution imposed through the CVE's, everybody is required to specify the security context of an `XStream` instance.
This change also has an impact on Axon Framework since the `XStreamSerializer` is the default serializer.
So as of this release, any usages of the default `XStreamSerializer` will come with warnings, stating it is highly recommended to use an `XStream` instance for which the security context is set through types or wildcards.
When your application uses Spring Boot, Axon will default to selecting the secured types based on your `@ComponentScan` annotated beans (e.g., like the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation).
For those interested in the details of the solution, check out https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1917[this] pull request.
* User 'nils-christian' noted in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1892[#1892] that Axon executed Upcaster beans in a Spring environment in the incorrect order.
This ordering issue was due to a misconception in deducing the `@Order` annotation on upcaster beans.
We resolved the problem in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1895[#1895].
* We noticed a `TokenStore` operation that Axon did not invoke within a transaction.
In most scenarios, this worked out, but when using Micronaut, for example, this (correctly) caused an exception.
After spotting the issue, we resolved it in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1908[this] pull request.

For an exhaustive list of all the changes, check out the https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.5.4[4.5.4 release notes].

=== Release 4.5.3

* One new feature has been introduced in 4.5.3: the `PropertySequencingPolicy` by contributor `nils-christian`.
This link:../../axon-framework/events/event-processors.md#sequential-processing[sequencing policy] can be configured to look for a common property in the events.
* The version of the `axonserver-connector-java` has been updated to 4.5.2.
This update resolves a troublesome issue around permit updates for subscription queries, which exhausted the number of queries an application could have running.
For those curious about the solution, pull request https://github.com/AxonIQ/axonserver-connector-java/pull/85[85] addresses this issue.
* The `WorkerLauncher` runnable, used by the `TrackingEventProcessor` to start its threads, was not considered when you shut down a tracking processor.
As a consequence, it could start new segment operations while `shutdown` already completed "successfully." Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1866[1866] resolves this problem, ensuring a tracking processor shuts down as intended.
* Issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1853[1853] describes an issue where the link:../../axon-framework/axon-framework-commands/command-handlers.md#aggregate-command-handler-creation-policy[creation policy] `always`.
Exceptions thrown from within a command handler annotated with `@CreationPolicy(ALWAYS)` weren't correctly propagated.
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1854[1854] solves this issue.

=== Release 4.5.2

* Added a missing `isReplaying` flag on the `StreamingEventProcessor`.
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1821[#1821] reintroduces this functionality in this release.
* Some enhancements in regards to logging Exceptions and stacktraces when initialization fails.
This https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/commit/197eabea4259f98a4a06c999e4bd5ed7b373a3d4[commit] reintroduces this functionality in this release.
* Improved Axon Framework (`AxonServerEventStore`) which will now rethrown Exceptions that has a valid `Status.Code`.
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1842[#1842] reintroduces this functionality in this release.
* General improvements on the `PooledStreamingEventProcessor` made across several Pull Requests.

For a detailed perspective on the release notes, please check https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.5.2[this] page.

=== Release 4.5.1

* Some internals have changed concerning command handling exceptions.
Within a single JVM, Axon Framework knows whether the exception is transient or not.
This piece of information allows the link:../../axon-framework/axon-framework-commands/infrastructure.md#configuring-the-command-gateway[`RetryScheduler`] to retry a non-transient exception since those are retryable.
With the move towards distributed environments, the information whether an exception is transient was lost when we moved to the dedicated `CommandHandlingException` containing a details object.
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1743[#1742] reintroduces this functionality in this release.
* The new `RevisionSnapshotFilter` introduced in release 4.5 sneaked in a bug by not validating the aggregate type upon filtering.
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1771[#1771] describes and solves the problem by introducing the aggregate type to the `RevisionSnapshotFilter`.
* By enabling the link:../../axon-framework/axon-framework-commands/command-handlers.md#aggregate-command-handler-creation-policy[`CreationPolicy`] for the link:../../axon-framework/axon-framework-commands/infrastructure.md#disruptorcommandbus[`DisruptorCommandBus`], a timing issue was introduced with handling events.
Contributor "junkdog" marked the problem in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1778[#1778], after which pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1792[#1792] solved it.
* Contributor "michaelbub" noted in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1786[#1786] that resetting a `StreamingEventProcessor` to a point in the future reacted differently when no token was stored yet.
This followed from the implementation of the `ReplayToken`, which wrongfully assumed that if the given 'token at reset' was `null`, the start position should be `null` too.
However, the start position might be the future, and hence it should be used in favor of `null`.
This issue is addressed under https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1802[this] pull request.

== Release 4.4

=== Release 4.4.9

Release 4.4.9 of Axon Framework has incremented _all_ used dependencies towards their latest bug release.
This has done to resolve potentially security issues, as was reported with XStream 1.4.14 (that was resolved in 1.4.16).

For those looking for the set of adjustments please take a look at tag https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.4.8[4.4.9]

=== Release 4.4.8

* A bug was noted whenever a query handler returned a `Future`/`CompletableFuture` in combination with a subscription query, with Axon Server as the infrastructure.
In this format, Axon would incorrectly use the scatter-gather query for the initial result of the subscription query.
Whenever the returned result was completed, this didn't cause any issues.
However, for a `Future`/`CompletableFuture` a `TimeoutException` would be thrown.
The issue was luckily easily mitigated by changing the "number of expected results" from within the `QueryRequest` to default to 1 instead of zero.
As an effect, the point-to-point would be invoked instead of scatter-gather.
For reference, the issue can be found https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1737[here].
* Whenever an interface is used as the type of an `@AggregateMember` annotated field, Axon would throw a `NullPointerException`.
This is far from friendly, and has been changed towards an `AxonConfigurationException` in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1742[#1742].

Note that the named issues comprise the complete changelist for https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.4.8[Axon Framework 4.4.8].

=== Release 4.4.7

* The https://github.com/AxonIQ/axonserver-connector-java[Axon Server Connector Java] version 4.4.7 has been included in this release as well.
As such, it's fixes (found https://github.com/AxonIQ/axonserver-connector-java/releases/tag/4.4.7[here]) are thus also part of this release.
* Contributor "krosenvold" noticed that the SQL to retrieve a stream of events was performed twice in quick concession.
The provided solution (in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1689[#1689]) would resolve this, but the problem was spotted to originate elsewhere.
Commit https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/commit/16b71529472ddb7345bd247ee5dd930dc6bd2206[16b7152] saw an end to this occurrence by making a minor tweak in the `EmbeddedEventStore`.
* As rightfully noticed by user "pepperbob", there was a type discrepancy when reading events through a tracking token.
An event would always become a `DomainEventMessage` when read through the `EventStorageEngine`, whereas it might originally have been a regular `EventMessage`.
The problem has been fixed in commit https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/commit/c61a95bff14cda0ed3fea154747067560a670b4d[c61a95b].
Furthermore, the entire description of the issue can be found https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1697[here].
* Through the use of the `AxonServerQueryBus`, a cancelled subscription query was wrongfully completed normally where it should complete exceptionally.
This problem is marked and resolved under pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1695[#1695].

For a detailed perspective on the release notes, please check https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.4.7[this] page.

=== Release 4.4.6

* Contributor "Rafaesp" noted that a registered `CommandHandlerInterceptor` in the `AggregateTestFixture` could be invoked more often than desired.
This only occurred if the fixture's `+givenCommands(...)+` method was invoked, but nonetheless this behaviour was incorrect.
The issue is marked under https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1665[#1665] and resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1666[#1666].
* In 4.4.4, a fix was introduced which ensured a `ChildEntity` (read, the Aggregate Members) was no longer duplicated in an aggregate hierarchy.
This fix had the troublesome side effect that aggregate member command handlers weren't registered on every level of the aggregate hierarchy anymore.
The resolution to this problem can be found in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1674[#1674].
* Using the subscription query in a distributed environment had a possible troublesome side effect.
If a consumer of updates was closed for whatever reason, it could also close the producing side.
This is obviously undesired, as no single consumer should influence if the producer should still dispatch updates to other consumers.
The problem was marked under issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1680[#1680] and resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/commit/9907ae9bc1374a58ad9c8eca3dad2004086e2261[this] commit.
* Right before we aimed to release 4.4.6, contributor "haraldk" provided a thorough issue description when using the `SequenceEventStorageEngine`.
He noted that if snapshots were used for an aggregate, there was a window of opportunity that the 'active' `EventStorageEngine` in the sequencing engine did not return any events.
This followed from the sequence number logic, which wrongfully defaulted to position "0", even though the starting sequence number is per definition higher if a snapshot has been found.
The clarifying issue can be found https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1682[here], with its resolution present in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1683[#1683].

For a complete overview of all the changes you can check the release notes https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.4.6[here].

=== Release 4.4.5

* When creating a `TrackingToken` at a certain position through `StreamableMessageSource#createTokenAt(Instant)`, a tail token was wrongfully returned if the provided timestamp exceeded the timestamp of the last event.
Instead, the token closests to the provided timestamp should be returned, was equals the head token.
This discrepancy between documentation and implementation was marked by `mbreevoort` and resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1607[#1607].
* A certain path within the `AxonServerEventStore` allowed for event retrieval without correctly deserializing the `MetaData` of the events.
If someone tried to access the `MetaData`, a `CannotConvertBetweenTypesException` was being thrown.
This problem, among others, was remedied in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1612[#1612], by ensuring the correct `Serializer` taking gRPC message types into account is consistently used.

For a complete set of the release notes, please check https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.4.5[here].

=== Release 4.4.4

* There was a bug which made it so that an `@ResetHandler` annotated method without any parameters was included for validation if a component could handle a specific type of event.
This exact validation is used to filter out events from the event stream to optimize the entire stream.
The optimization was thus mitigated by the simple fact of introducing a default `@ResetHandler`.
The problem was marked by `@kad-hesseg` (for which thanks) and resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1597[#1597].
* A new `SnapshotTriggerDefinition` called `AggregateLoadTimeSnapShotTriggerDefinition` has been introduced, which uses the load time of an aggregate to trigger a snapshot creation.
* When using an aggregate class hierarchy, `@AggregateMember` annotated fields present on the root would be duplicated for every class in the hierarchy which included message handling functions.
This problem was traced back to the `AnnotatedAggregateMetaModelFactory.AnnotatedAggregateModel` which looped over an inconsistent set of classes to find these members.
The issue was marked by `@kad-malota` and resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1595[#1595].

For a complete set of the release notes, please check https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/releases/tag/axon-4.4.4[here].

=== Release 4.4.3

* An optimization in the snapshotting process was introduced in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1510[#1510].
This PR ensures no unnecessary snapshots are staged in the `AbstractSnapshotter` by validating none have been scheduled yet.
This fix will resolve potential high I.O.
when snapshots are being recreated for aggregates which have a high number of events.
* The assignment rules used by the `EventProcessingConfigurer` weren't always taken into account as desired.
This inconsistency compared to regular assignment through the `@ProcessingGroup` annotation has been resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1500[this] pull request.
* Heartbeat messages between Axon Server and an Axon Framework application were already configurable, but only from the server's side.
Properties have been introduced to also enables this from the clients end, as specified further in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1511[this] pull request.
Enabling heartbeat messages will ensure the connection is preemptively closed if no response has been received in the configured time frame.

=== Release 4.4.2

* A persistent loop of 500ms was spotted during event consumption from Axon Server.
Credits go to Damir Murat who has spotted the https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1481[issue].
With his help the issue was found quickly and eventually resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1484[#1484].
* A serialization issue was found when working with the `ConfigToken` and de-/serialize it through the `JacksonSerializer`.
This problem was uncovered in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1482[#1482] and resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1485[#1485].
* The introduction of the https://github.com/AxonIQ/axonserver-connector-java[AxonServer Connector for Java] to simplify the framework's integration with Axon Server introduced some configuration issues.
For example, the `AxonServerConfiguration#isForceReadFromLeader` wasn't used when opening an event stream (resolved in PR https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1488[#1488]).
* Furthermore, properties like the `max-message-size`, gRPC keep alive settings and `processorNotificationRate` weren't used when forming a connection with Axon Server.
This issue was covered by pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1487[#1487].

https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22Release+4.4.2%22[This] page shares a complete list of all resolved issues for this release.

=== Release 4.4.1

A single fix was performed as soon as possible to release 4.4, in conjunction with the new https://github.com/AxonIQ/axonserver-connector-java[Axon Server Connector] used by this release.
There was an off by one scenario when an Event Processor started reading events from the beginning of time.
This meant that the first event in the event store was systematically skipped.
The bug was resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/commit/3a055407437589bc1388cecca0b6e2f0bc61ea26[this] commit.

== Release 4.3

=== Release 4.3.5

* The `TrackingEventProcessor#mergeSegment(int)` method was invoked with the high segment number of the pair to merge,
+
an error would occur in the process as it expected to receive the lower number on all scenarios.
+
This was resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1450[#1450].

* A small connectivity adjustment which was performed in the `AxonServerConnectionManager` for bug release 4.3.4 has been reverted.
+
Although it worked successfully for some scenarios, it did not correctly cover all possibilities.
+
The commit can be found https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/commit/5b9348040f4f977db3b9a15c3ae55904710814b6[here] for reference.
+
The full scenario will be covered through the adjusted connector which is underway for beta release in 4.4.

=== Release 4.3.4

* Whilst adjusting the `JdbcEventStorageEngine` in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1187[#1187] to allow more flexibility to configure the used statements, we accidentally dropped support for adjusting how the store wrote timestamps.
+
This issue was rectified by user `ovstetun` in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1454[#1454].

* Snapshots were incorrectly created in the same phase as the publication of events.
+
This has been moved to the after commit phase of the `UnitOfWork` in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1457[#1457].

* When using the `SequenceEventStorageEngine` to merge an active and historic event stream there was a discrepancy when the active stream didn't contain any events and the historic stream did.
+
This has been resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1459[#1459].

=== Release 4.3.3

This bug release contained a single fix, under pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1425[#1425].
A situation was reported where a Tracking Event Processor did not catch up with the last event, until a new event was available after that event.
Effectively causing it to read up to N-1.
This only accounted for usages of the `MultiStreamableMessageSource`, thus when two (or more) event streams were combined into a single source for a `TrackingEventProcessor`.

To remain complete, https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22Release+4.3.3%22++label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22+[here] is the issue tracker page contained the closed issues for release 4.3.3.

=== Release 4.3.2

* When using the `QueryGateway`, it was not possible to provide a `QueryMessage` as the query field since the `queryName` would be derived from the class name of the provided query.
+
Hence, `QueryMessage` would be the `queryName`, instead of the actual `queryName`.
+
This issue has been resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1410[#1410].

* There was a window of opportunity where the `Snapshotter` would publish the last event in its stream twice.
+
This could cause faulty snapshots in some scenarios.
+
This issue was marked under https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1408[#1408] and resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1416[#1416].

* The bi-directional stream created by the Axon Server Connector wasn't always closed correctly;
specifically in error cases.
+
This problem has been resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1397[1397].

=== Release 4.3.1

* Through the new link:../../axon-framework/axon-framework-commands/command-handlers.md#aggregate-command-handler-creation-policy[Create-or-Update]
+
feature a bug was introduced which didn't allow non-String aggregate identifiers.
+
This problem was quickly resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1363[#1363],
+
allowing the usage of "complex" aggregate identifiers once more.

* The graceful shutdown process introduced in 4.3 had a couple of minor problems.
+
One of which was the shutdown order within the `AxonServerCommandBus` and `AxonServerQueryBus`,
+
which basically made it so that the approach prior to 4.3 was maintained.
+
We also noticed that the `AxonServerConnectionManager` never shutdown nicely.
+
All of these, plus some other minor fixes, have been performed in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1372[#1372].

* The `AggregateCreationPolicy#ALWAYS` did not behave as expected, resulting in faulty behaviour when used.
+
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1371[#1371] saw an end to this problem,
+
ensuring the desired usage of all newly introduced creation policies.

== Release 4.2

=== Release 4.2.2

* In a distributed setup, the `DisruptorCommandBus` was not always correctly identified as being the local segment.
+
Due to this, aggregate repositories weren't created by the `DisruptorCommandBus` as is required in such a configuration.
+
This was marked in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/874[#874] and resolved through https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1287[#1287].

* As described in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1274[#1274],
+
a query handler with return type `Future` was not being returned at all but threw an exception.
+
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1323[#1323] solved that in 4.2.2.

* An issue was solved where the `JdbcAutoConfiguration` unintentionally depended on a JPA specific class.

=== Release 4.2.1

* A one-to-many `Upcaster` instance tied to Axon Server would only use the first event result and ignore the rest.
+
This issue has been resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1264[#1264].

* The `axon-legacy` module's `GapAwareTrackingToken` did not implement the `TrackingToken` interface.
+
This was marked in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1230[#1230] and resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1231[#1231].

* The builders of the `ExponentialBackOffIntervalRetryScheduler` and `IntervalRetryScheduler` previously
+
did not implement the `validate()` method correctly.
+
Through this a `NullPointerException` could occur on start-up,
+
as marked in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1293[#1293].

== Release 4.1

=== Release 4.1.2

* A dependency on `XStream` was enforced undesirably through the Builder pattern introduced in 4.0.
+
This has been resolved by using a `Supplier` of a `Serializer` in the Builders instead, as described under https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1054[this] issue.

* Due to a hierarchy issue in the Spring Boot auto configuration, the `JdbcTokenStore` was not always used as expected.
+
The ordering has been fixed under issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1077[#1077].

* The ordering of message handling functions was incorrect according to the documentation.
+
Classes take precedence over interface, and the depth of interface hierarchy is calculated based on the inheritance level (as described https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1129[here]).

=== Release 4.1.1

* Query Dispatch Interceptors were not called correctly when a link:../../axon-framework/queries/query-dispatchers.md#subscription-queries[subscription query] was performed when Axon Server was used as the `QueryBus`.
+
This issue was marked https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1013[here] and resolved in pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1042[#1042].

* When Axon Server was (auto) configured without being able to connect to an actual instance, processing instructions were incorrectly dispatched regardless.
+
Pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1040[#1040] resolves this by making sure an active connection is present.

* The Spring Boot auto configuration did not allow the exclusion of the `axon-server-connector` dependency due to a direct dependency on classes.
+
This has been resolved by expecting fully qualified class names as Strings instead (resolved under https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1041[this] pull request).

* The `JpaEventStorageEngine` was not wrapping the `appendEvents` operation in a transaction.
+
Problem has been resolved under issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/1035[#1035].

== Release 4.0

=== Release 4.0.4

* Deserialization failures were accidentally swallowed by the command and query gateway (marked under https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/967[#967]).
* Resolved an issue where custom exception in a Command Handling constructor caused `NullPointerExceptions`.

=== Release 4.0.3

* The `SimpleQueryBus` reported exceptions on the initial result incorrectly upon performing a subscription query.
+
Issue has been described and resolved under https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/913[#913].

* Resolved issue where the the "download Axon Server" message was shown upon a reconnect of an application to a Axon Server node.
* Large global index gaps between events caused issues when querying the event stream (described https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/419[here]).
* Fixed inconsistency in the `GlobalSequenceTrackingToken#covers(TrackingToken)` method.

=== Release 4.0.2

* A timeout was thrown instead of a exception by Axon Server when a duplicate aggregate id was created, which is resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/903[#903].
* Command or Query handling exceptions were not properly serialized through Axon Server (resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/904[#904]).

=== Release 4.0.1

* Resolved `QueryUpdateEmitter` configuration for the Axon Server connector set up (see issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/896[here]).
