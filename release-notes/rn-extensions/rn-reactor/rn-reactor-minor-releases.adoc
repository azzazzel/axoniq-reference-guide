= Minor Releases

Any patch release made for an Axon project aims to resolve bugs.
This page provides an overview of patch releases for the Axon Reactor Extension.

== Release 4.5

== Release 4.5.1

The 4.5.1 release contains a single fix, namely pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-reactor/pull/93[#93].
This fix adjusts bugs within the `ReactorCommandGateway` and `ReactorQueryGateway` builders.
The result interceptors for the command gateway and the dispatch interceptor for the query gateway weren't included when they were set through the builder.

== Release 4.4

=== Release 4.4.3

* Issues arose when using Spring Boot Dev Tools in combination with the Axon Reactor Extension.
Contributor `magnusheino` noted this problem in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-reactor/issues/28[#28].
* The `ReactorCommandGateway` and `ReactorQueryGateway` introduced a discrepancy compared to Axon Framework.
Namely, the gateways swallowed exceptions instead of throwing them to the user.
We resolved this issue in https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-reactor/pull/18[this] pull request by unwrapping the exception message into the returned `Mono` or `Flux`
