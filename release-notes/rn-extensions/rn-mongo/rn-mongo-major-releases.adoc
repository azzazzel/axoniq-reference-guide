== Release 4.5

* We introduced a dedicated sample project to the Mongo Extension.
The sample is written in Kotlin and shows how to use the `MongoEventStorageEngine` and `MongoTokenStore`.
For those interested, you can find the pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/pull/65[here].
* Contributor `erikrz` provided an issue *and* pull request to allow the `MongoTokenStore` index to be automatically validated.
Issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/issues/51[#51] marks the request, whereas https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/pull/53[#53] marks the pull request.
* The `MongoTokenStore` now implements the `retrieveStorageIdentifier` method, as of pull request https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/pull/139[#139].
This change allows clustered environments, like Axon Server, to tell apart the Mongo Databases of Event Processors.
This further benefits split, merge and release operations performed in a distributed environment.

We refer to the https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/releases/tag/axon-mongo-4.5[release notes] for a complete list of all changes.

== Release 4.4

* Issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/pull/10[#10] introduces support for Spring Boot Developer Tools.
* Contributor `bjornharvold` provided a pull request to update the MongoDB java driver to 4.0.3.
For those interested in the adjustments, you can check them out https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/pull/12[here].

== Release 4.3

We did not introduce any significant changes other than updating the extension to use Axon Framework release 4.3.

== Release 4.2

We did not introduce any significant changes other than updating the extension to use Axon Framework release 4.2.

== Release 4.1

Contributor `mwlynch` introduced a small improvement on the `MongoTokenStore` and `MongoEventStorageEngine`.
Namely, he removed the `@PostConstruct` annotation from the `ensureIndexes()` methods and moved the invocation to the constructor.
For the specific changes, we refer to https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/pull/2[this] pull request.

== Release 4.0

We split off the Mongo logic from Axon Framework core into a dedicated repository.
Next to that, it complies with Axon Framework's 4.0 release.
