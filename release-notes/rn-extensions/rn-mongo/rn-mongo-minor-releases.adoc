= Minor Releases

Any patch release made for an Axon project aims to resolve bugs.
This page provides an overview of patch releases for the Axon Mongo Extension.

== Release 4.1

=== Release 4.1.1

Axon Framework release 4.1 saw the introduction of split and merge operations.
These impact the `TokenStore` interface, more specifically with the ``initializeSegment(TrackingToken, String, int) and ``deleteToken(String, int)`.

Issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/issues/3[#3] marks the requirement for the `MongoTokenStore` to implement these as well.

== Release 4.0

=== Release 4.0.1

The Mongo extension incorrectly used the content type instead of the tokens type upon storing a serialized token.
The issue was marked and resolved under https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo/issues/1[#1].
