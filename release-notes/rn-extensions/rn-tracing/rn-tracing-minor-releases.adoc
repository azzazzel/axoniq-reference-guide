== Release 4.5

=== Release 4.5.2

* Bumped Axon Framework version used from 4.5.
to 4.5.5 https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-tracing/commit/3cad35ce3fdba6e4398bb5471383685ecf2b686e[here] commit.
* An edge case was fixed where the `QueryGateway` could throws a `NullPointerException`.
The fix for it was done https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-tracing/pull/218[here].

=== Release 4.5.1

* With the release of Spring-Boot 2.6.0, the problem with circular dependencies came to light.
To make it possible to use tracing-extension together with spring-boot 2.6.0, a circular dependency on our code was fixed as can be seen https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-tracing/commit/b4de5e3347568a7b5ca3c646ef96cdf4d1293f71[here].

== Release 4.3

=== Release 4.3.1

* The tag for the query payload was wrong.
We give credits to contributor `Sam-Kruglov` for noting the issue, which we resolved in https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-tracing/commit/72c8b15fec144c62fe6115d4993d60ab93ecee07[this] commit.
* In some Tracing UI's, camel-cased tag names showed up without the separation.
This discrepancy is marked in issue https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-tracing/issues/45[#45] and resolved by using a dash notation instead of camel casing.
